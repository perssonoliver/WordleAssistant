TODO: 
    - add option to reset the latest row 
    - add transition when opening help component
    - change fonts
    - add tips for valid words (most frequent letter, most common position of yellow letter etc)
    - add word suggestions to narrow down list according to tips above

BUGS: 
    - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList') (happens sometimes when pressing enter when whole row is not filled (might be wrong, investigate further))
    - exiting the help screen does not refocus the current box
