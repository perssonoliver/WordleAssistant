TODO: 
    - replace delete button text with image
    - remove color from box when deleting letter
    - add option reset latest row as well as every row
    - selecting a word from the wordlist should preselect it in the grid

BUGS: 
    - size of grid boxes, key boxes, and the labels inside them should be fixed (compare with real wordle, minimizing the window size should not shrink the boxes)
