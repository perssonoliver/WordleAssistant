TODO: 
    - replace delete button text with image
    - remove color from box when deleting letter
    - add option reset latest row as well as every row
    - selecting a word from the wordlist should preselect it in the grid
    - update green and yellow colors
    - refactor word list filtering code
    - current row should show a different default grey 
    - move enter button next to the current row or highlight it when it can be pressed 
    - add functionality for pressing 'real' keyboard instead of screen keyboard

BUGS: 
    - size of grid boxes, key boxes, and the labels inside them should be fixed (compare with real wordle, minimizing the window size should not shrink the boxes)
