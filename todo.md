TODO: 
    - add option to reset the latest row 
    - refactor word list filtering code
    - add functionality for pressing 'real' keyboard instead of screen keyboard
    - default item in wordlist should not be a list item 
    - add transition when opening help component
    - change fonts

BUGS: 
    - when user presses backspace button and row is filled, it doesn't remove last letter (because col is 5, so last col box is not highlighted)
    - pressing anywhere outside the main grid should not unfocus the current box
