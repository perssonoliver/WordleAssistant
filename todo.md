TODO: 
    - add option to reset the latest row 
    - refactor word list filtering code
    - add functionality for pressing 'real' keyboard instead of screen keyboard
    - default item in wordlist should not be a list item 
    - add transition when opening help component
    - change fonts

BUGS: 
    - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'classList') (happens sometimes when pressing enter when whole row is not filled (might be wrong, investigate further))
    - exiting the help screen does not refocus the current box
