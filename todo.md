TODO: 
    - add option to reset latest row as well as every row
    - refactor word list filtering code
    - move enter button next to the current row or highlight it when it can be pressed 
    - add functionality for pressing 'real' keyboard instead of screen keyboard
    - default item in wordlist should not be a list item 
    - add reset button and help button above grid 
    - create help component with user instructions 

BUGS: 
    - size of grid boxes, key boxes, and the labels inside them should be fixed (compare with real wordle, minimizing the window size should not shrink the boxes)
    - coloring boxes from previous rows should not be possible
